# Develop a HTML5 Cloud Application

## Introduction

SAP Business Application Studio comes out of the box with predefined set of development environments â€“ Dev-Spaces (virtual machine on the cloud where you can develop, build, test and run using pre-installed runtimes and tools) tailored for developing SAP business scenarios.

Create a simple UI extension application in SAP Business Application Studio using existing project templates in order to consume the Business Partner OData service. This application will run as a stand-alone application without a SAP Lauchpad.
