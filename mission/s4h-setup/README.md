# Set Up the SAP S/4HANA System
> To run this mission you will need an SAP S/4HANA 2023 system or later

In this section, you will learn how to activate an OData API service in a SAP S/4HANA system, create a user and assign the necessary roles and authorization objects.

You need to be an SAP S/4HANA administrator to be able to follow the steps. 

***Hint:** The following screenshots are done with SAP GUI 7.50 - by using SAP GUI 7.60 the usage could differ, for example tick button instead of a continue button and so on.*

## Activate the OData Service
1. Log in to the SAP S/4HANA system using SAP GUI with your administrator user.
2. Call the /n/IWFND/MAINT\_SERVICE transaction.
3. Choose **Add Service**.

   ![Add Service](./images/add-service.png)
   
4. In the **Add Selected Serviced** screen, enter the following values:
   1. System Alias = LOCAL
   2. Technical Service Name = API\_BU*
   3. Press **Enter** - you should see the API\_BUSINESS\_PARTNER in the list.
   
   ![Add selected Service](./images/add-selected-service.png)

5. Select the **API\_BUSINESS\_PARTNER** checkbox and choose **Add Selected Service**.

   2. Select the **Enable OAuth for Service** checkbox.
   3. Choose **Continue** to activate the changes.
   4. Choose **Continue** to confirm the message box.

1. Call the SU01 transaction:
   1. Enter a user ID.
   2. Choose **Create**.

### Test the API\_BUSINESS\_PARTNER\_SRV

To see if the setup was done correctly, let us test the Business Partner API with the new user. 

* Call Transaction /N/IWFND/MAINT\_SERVICE with your admin user.
    1. Double-click on ZAPI\_BUSINESS\_PARTNER
    2. Choose **Call Browser**

   
    ![Test Bupa](./images/test-bupa1.png)
    
    Hint: If you use a CAL system, kindly check and use the relevant IP address instead of the default system host name as the host name has to be resolvable by the browser.

* Enter the credentials of the new user which you have created. You should then see the structure of the BusinessPartner OData service.

    ![Test Bupa](./images/test-bupa2.png)

*  Change the end ot the URL to ..../sap/API\_BUSINESS\_PARTNER/A\_BusinessPartner/?$format=xml. You should now see a list of Business Partners.

This completes this mission section.



## Summary

You have activated an API in the S/4 on-premise system and created a user with the necessary roles for CRUD operations of Business Partner data and to access the API\_BUSINESS\_PARTNER\_SRV OData service.

***Hint:** the simplest way for adding additional users with the same roles is just to copy this user profile in the SU01 transaction*
