# Mission: Setup for SAP S/4HANA side-by-side UI Extensions on SAP Business Technology Platform

The main focus of this mission is to show the full end-to-end setup for a SAP S/4HANA on-premise extension on SAP BTP (Cloud Foundry) this includes the following steps:
* Setup SAP S/4HANA on-premise system
* Setup of SAP BTP account and development environment
* End-to-End connection setup with Principal Propagation (SSO)
* DevOps - using SAP Continuous Integration & Delivery and monitoring
* Integration of the HTML5 application in a central company site with SAP Workzone

We will create a simple custom UI application, show the usage of the HTML5 repository and the different options how to expose this application - as a stand-alone or with the SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition environment to establish a unified point of access to SAP (e.g. SAP S/4HANA), custom-built, and third party applications and extensions, both on the cloud and on premise. Note: SAP Launchpad service was recently renamed to SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition.

These are the step-by-step guidelines for running the mission. It is divided in two workstreams:

## Landscape Setup

The setup of the landscape consists of preparing the API in the SAP S/4HANA on-premise system and exposing the backend oData service using SAP Cloud Connector. There are also step-by-step instructions to setup the trust between SAP Cloud Connector and SAP S/4HANA system.

* [Setup of SAP S/4HANA system from the SAP Cloud Appliance Library](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-extension-ecc-business-process/blob/mission/mission/cal-setup/CALS4H.md)
* [Set Up the SAP S/4HANA on-premise System](./s4h-setup/README.md)
* [Set Up SAP Cloud Connector & Trust to the SAP S/4HANA System](./cloud-connector/README.md)
* [Set Up the SAP Business Technology Platform Account](./scp-setup/README.md)
* [End-to-End Connectivity Setup](./connectivity/README.md)
* [Set Up SAP Identity and Authentication Service (optional)](./custom-idp/README.md)


## Implementation of a simple UI application

Once we have setup the landscape, we can now develop, test and run a simple UI application. We will show the steps to implement the simple UI application using the SAP BTP managed HTML5 repository. This is a kind of PoC to see if and how the whole landscape setup is working.

* [Develop a simple UI application](./create-application/develop/README.md)
* [Test the simple UI application](./create-application/test/README.md)
* [Build and deploy the application to your SAP BTP Cloud Foundry account](./create-application/buildDeploy/README.md)
* [Integrate the Continous Integration & Continous Delivery Service](./ci-cd-service/README.md)
* [Integrate the Application with SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition](./launchpad/README.md)
