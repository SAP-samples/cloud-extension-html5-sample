# Setup of a SAP Business Technology Platform subccount manually

## Introduction

**Abbreviation:** SAP Business Technology Platform = SAP BTP

For running the HTML5 mission you will need the following services in your SAP BTP account:

* SAP Business Application Studio
* SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition   
* SAP HTML5 Application (kernel service - no quota necessary)
* SAP Continuous Integration & Delivery Service (optional)

The entitlement differs for the pricing option of your account:

**Consumption-based SAP BTP Account:** 
No entitlement necessary. Be sure that you have enough credits to run the services.

**Subscription-based SAP BTP Account:** 
You have to create entitlements for the services above - [see also Entitlements and Quotas](https://help.sap.com/viewer/df50977d8bfa4c9a8a063ddb37113c43/Cloud/en-US/38ecf59cdda64150a102cfaa62d5faab.html#loio363f0f68f9704830ac65c87a2562559b).

**Free Tier option with Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) or Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement (CPEA) account** or **SAP Business Technology Platform Trial**

Free tier is not a distinct account but a set of entitlement plans within a consumption-based (PAYG/CPEA) global account for activating certain services for free.

Note: "free tier" only applies for services in SAP Business Technology Platform.

In this mission all the services from the SAP BTP are available in 'free' service plan, so check the following steps to create subscriptions to services and to assign relevant roles to your SAP BTP User.

You can also use a trial account in SAP BTP in this mission, another offering by SAP to test SAP BTP capabilities for free. The trial account is an isolated global account in SAP BTP. The subaccounts that you create come with pre-allocated service entitlements. After your trial account has been deleted, either on purpose or automatically, if you donâ€™t use it for 365 days, all data and artifacts are deleted permanently.

To create and set up a trial account, see the [Get a Free Account on SAP BTP Trial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) tutorial in the Tutorial Navigator.


**Persona:** Cloud Administrator
