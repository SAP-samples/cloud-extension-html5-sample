# Mission: Setup for SAP S/4HANA side-by-side UI Extensions on SAP Business Technology Platform
[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-extension-html5-sample)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-extension-html5-sample)

The main focus of this mission is to show the full end-to-end setup for a SAP S/4HANA on-premise extension on SAP BTP (Cloud Foundry) this includes the following steps:
* Setup SAP S/4HANA on-premise system
* Setup of SAP BTP account and development environment
* End-to-End connection setup with Principal Propagation (SSO)
* DevOps - using SAP Continuous Integration & Delivery and monitoring
* Integration of the HTML5 application in a central Launchpad

We will create a simple custom UI application, show the usage of the HTML5 repository and the different options how to expose this application - as a stand-alone or with the different SAP Launchpads environments.

* [Learn about SAP Launchpad Service and SAP Work Zone](../../tree/mission/mission/discover/Launchpad.md)
* [Learn about Observability on SAP BTP](../../tree/mission/mission/discover/Observability.md)

These are the step-by-step guidelines for running the mission. It is divided in two workstreams:

## Landscape Setup

The setup of the landscape consists of preparing the API in the SAP S/4HANA on-premise system and exposing the backend oData service using SAP Cloud Connector. There are also step-by-step instructions to setup the trust between SAP Cloud Connector and SAP S/4HANA system.

* [Setup of SAP S/4HANA system from the SAP Cloud Appliance Library](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-extension-ecc-business-process/blob/mission/mission/cal-setup/CALS4H.md)
* [Setup of S/4HANA on-premise System](../../tree/mission/mission/s4h-setup/README.md)
* [Setup of SAP Cloud Connector & Trust to the SAP S/4HANA System](../../tree/mission/mission/cloud-connector/README.md)
* [Setup of SAP Business Technology Platform Account](../../tree/mission/mission/scp-setup/README.md)
* [End-to-End Connectivity Setup](../../tree/mission/mission/connectivity/README.md)
* [Setup SAP Identity and Authentication Service (optional)](../../tree/mission/mission/custom-idp/README.md)

## Implementation of a custom OData service

After the setup is done we can start to create UI API for the future application. Standard APIs provided by SAP cannot be used for this purpose.

* [Motivation](../../tree/mission/mission/rap-service/motivation.md)
* [Explore Business Object Projection](../../tree/mission/mission/rap-service/explore-projection.md)
* [Set up the ABAP Development Tools](../../tree/mission/mission/rap-service/adt-setup.md)
* [Create the Data Definition](../../tree/mission/mission/rap-service/create-data-definitions.md)
* [Create the Metadata Extension](../../tree/mission/mission/rap-service/create-metadata-extension.md)
* [Expose the OData Service](../../tree/mission/mission/rap-service/expose.md)
* [Test the Service](../../tree/mission/mission/rap-service/test.md)

## Implementation of a simple UI application

Once we have setup the landscape, we can now develop, test and run a simple UI application. We will show the steps to implement the simple UI application using the SAP BTP managed HTML5 repository. This is a kind of PoC to see if and how the whole landscape setup is working.

* [Develop a simple UI application](../../tree/mission/mission/create-application/develop/README.md)
* [Test the simple UI application](../../tree/mission/mission/create-application/test/README.md)
* [Build and deploy the application to your SAP BTP Cloud Foundry account](../../tree/mission/mission/create-application/buildDeploy/README.md)
* [Integrate the Continous Integration & Continous Delivery Service](../../tree/mission/mission/ci-cd-service/README.md)
* [Publishing your application to a SAP Launchpad site](../../tree/mission/mission/launchpad/README.md)
